## Identifying Toxic Behaviour in Reddit gaming communities! 🎮

## Project Description:

Throughout my research journey, I explored the complex world of online communities and delved into the challenges of tackling toxic behavior. Here's a sneak peek into my dissertation, where I addressed the problem of toxicity in Reddit gaming communities and developed innovative solutions using Python, #nlp #machinelearning Gephi and Polinode.

## 🎯 Problem Statement:

The rise of online gaming communities has brought both joy and challenges. However, one significant challenge is the prevalence of toxic behavior that can negatively impact the gaming experience. My dissertation aimed to identify and understand this toxic behavior, ultimately leading to the development of effective strategies for fostering healthier and more inclusive gaming communities.

## 🔍 Data Collection:

To tackle this problem, I embarked on an extensive data collection process. I gathered vast amounts of Reddit posts and comments from Activision Subreddit, creating a comprehensive dataset that allowed me to capture the diverse interactions and behaviors.

## 📉 Identifying Negative Content and Users:

Using the power of Python, I employed sophisticated techniques to analyze the collected data and identify negative content and toxic users. I leveraged natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and machine learning models to distinguish toxic behavior, such as hate speech, harassment, and disrespectful language, from regular interactions.

## 📊 Sentiment Analysis:

In order to gain deeper insights into the emotional undercurrents of the gaming communities, I conducted sentiment analysis on the collected data. By employing sentiment analysis algorithms, I was able to discern the prevailing sentiments within the community, ranging from positive and neutral to negative emotions, shedding light on the overall tone and atmosphere of these communities.

## 📈 Building a Predictive Model:

One of the highlights of my research was the development of a predictive model using Python. By integrating the insights obtained from the previous stages, I created a robust model capable of predicting the likelihood of toxic behavior within Reddit gaming communities.
